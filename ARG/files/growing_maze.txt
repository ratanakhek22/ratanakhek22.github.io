Welcome to the never ending, Growing Maze.
From the name, you will never find a dead end and instead
the walls will lead you further and further away from the exit.

Fortunately, you have this note, explain the rules and ways around the maze.
Unfortunately, the person who wrote this note is not very straightforward.

Maze Rules:
1. The path to the exit has a total of IX intersections, no more no less.
2. You will magically leave the maze anytime if you just go backwards 3 times in a row.
3. To begin, start your step count at 0, after choosing a direction, increment it by 1.
4. To clear the maze you must follow my instructions precisely for EACH room.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
direction = back
    if the flowers are NOT red:
        direction = left
        if flock is at most 2:
            direction = forward
        if your step count is a multiple of 3:
            direction = right

    if the flowers are NOT blue:
        if direction == left:
            direction = forward
        if your step count is even:
            direction = left
        if your last step was left:
            direction = right

    if flock is greater than 3:
        direction = forward

Turn in the direction.
