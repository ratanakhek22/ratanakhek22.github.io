In this chest, where your flag lies,
is a lock of six, with clues nearby.

No key of brass, no blade nor code,
will open what the stars have showed.
But through the lens that stares on high,
the truth is drawn across the sky.

A compass forged in stardust thread,
Spins slow beneath the moon's cold head.
It points not north, but rather wide,
To where six shapes in darkness hide.

For all you find with steady gaze,
Note the angle through the haze.
A number gleaned from skyward grace,
A piece to fit in sequence, place by place.
